# OurBlog
A communist blog in a sarcastic way.

My goal in that project is to create a blog while understanding how django works. This junk blog has a motto which is "Not mine, not yours, just ours. The communist blog!".
You can create articles to share free information, add adverts for free stuff. Basically, the blog is based on sharing and free stuff as communism embraces. So, the idea has been 
inspired ironically, but real communists are welcomed :)
